# MediKeep

## Inspiration
In countries without centralized medical history storage like India, doctors and patients have to maintain their own copies for each document. This leads to problems in storage and in remembering each documentâ€™s physical or digital location. This makes doctor visits an arduous task.

## What it does
In simple terms, it lets you maintain medical reports and medical measurements like blood sugar levels, etc. and share with them your doctor in a secure manner.
