## Inspiration
In countries without centralized medical history storage like India, doctors and patients have to maintain their own copies for each document. This leads to problems in storage and in remembering each documentâ€™s physical or digital location. This makes doctor visits an arduous task.

## What it does
In simple terms, it lets you maintain medical reports and medical measurements like blood sugar levels, etc. and share with them your doctor in a secure manner.

## Tech Stack
1.  Gatsby
2.  Firebase
3.  Netlify

## How it works
1. A PWA has been built using Gatsby as our frontend that uses firebase for Authentication, file storage and database.
2. The user sign's up to the platform, getting a view to upload and manage their reports.
3. With all the reports in one place it gets easier to find and share medical history with doctor.

## How to use it
 1. Install All Dependencies:
 ```npm i```
 2. Start the Project:
 ```npm start```
